  <p>The first in what has now been called the Atari 8-bit family of computers, the Atari 400/800 machines both released in 1979. The 400 was the lower cost machine that included one cartridge slot, while the 800 was the higher cost that had two cartridge slots but also included upgradeable ram slots.</p>

<div class="description paragraph">
		<p>The Atari 520ST first released in 1985 was meant as a successor to the 8-bit family, but also to rival equally powerful 16 bit machines like the Commodore Amiga. Unlike the Commodore Amiga the ST initially did better right out of the gate due to the lower price. Consumers were given the option of a less expensive monochrome color scheme, or the more expensive color palette.</p>
