<div><p>Released in 1982 the Commodore 64 is perhaps the most well known and best selling 8 bit computer of the 80's. The key to the 64's success was it being targeted more at the general public rather than just for business or schools. The C64 was popular enough to get several variations including, the SX-64 which holds the distinction of being the first commercially viable full color portable computer, the Educator 64 which reused the commodore pets design, The Commodore 64 C was also a slimmed down cost reduced version, then in the early 90's the C64 was re released for a final time as the Commodore 64 Games System which came with a single joystick but lacked a keyboard. The C64 wouldn't be discontinued until April 1994 Commodore itself would file for bankruptcy the same year.</p></div>

<div class="description paragraph"><p>First released in 1985 the Amiga 500 was Commodore's first 16 bit computer. Supporting a full color GUI full 3d rendering an impressive feat for a mass market computer, the amiga was set to compete with other GUI based machines such as apple's Machintosh and Atari's 520 ST yet despite all the technical leaps it didn't do well out of the gate. The reason for it's slow start was poor marketing, and the price at 1,295 USD it didn't help that there wasn't a whole lot of software available at launch. Over the years the amiga would slowly start to turn a profit helped by its various versions including the cost reduced Amiga 1000, the Amiga 2000 which included ram upgrade slots, the amiga 300, 500 plus, and 600 all in introduced in the early 90's. After Commodore went bankrupt the rights to the Amiga operating system were sold to various different companies and is now owned by a belgian company called Hyperion Entertainment, and saw its final update 4.1 on January 12 2021</p>.
