<div class="description paragraph">
  <p>IBM, seeing the growing success of the Apple and Commodore computers, decided to design their own and own the market based on their strong name in the business world.
    
    The PC was designed with support for expansion cards, a feature only present in the Apple II up until that time.
    
    It was based on the Intel 8088 CPU, not the best option at the time but more affordable. It was also assembler-compatible with the Z80. This was significant because the original plan was to port the CP/M operating system, based on the Z80. But IBM instead ended up licensing DOS from Microsoft.
