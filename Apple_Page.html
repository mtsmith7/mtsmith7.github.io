<div class="description paragraph">
  <p>The Apple II released in 1977, was perhaps the first successful microcomputer released to the general public. Part of its success was due to its inclusion in schools like the commodore pet, but also due to its ease of use. At the time computers were still thought of as large bulky machines which only government employees could understand, the Apple II was on the first computers to break that mindset. Apple would continue to upgrade the II line for a number of years including the Apple II plus, the Apple IIe, and the Apple IIc. The Apple II series would last until October 1993.</p>

<div class="description paragrah">
  <p>Apple's Lisa made one major innovation in the world of computing by being the first to ship with a graphical user interface or GUI for short. Lisa as a computer was impressive for 1983 but the its heavy price tag of 9,995 USD turned off all but the most wealthy buisnessmen. Lisa was a commercial flop.</p>

<div class="description paragraph">
<p>In 1984 the first in the now ongoing line of Machintosh computers was released, learning from the failures of the Lisa which focused primarily on businessmen the Machintosh was designed with ease of use, and affordability. The mac was also the first computer to use 3.5" floppy disks.</p></div>
